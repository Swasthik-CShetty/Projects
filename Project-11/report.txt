PROJECT REPORT
FINGERPRINT BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM
1. Introduction

Biometrics is a technology that uses unique physical or behavioral traits to identify individuals. Examples include fingerprints, face, iris, and voice. Fingerprint recognition is one of the most widely used biometric authentication techniques due to its accuracy, uniqueness, and ease of acquisition.

This project presents a Fingerprint Biometric Identification System using Python and OpenCV. The system allows users to enroll their fingerprint along with personal details and verify identity using fingerprint matching. The core algorithm uses ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) for fingerprint feature extraction and BFMatcher (Brute Force Matcher) for matching features.

2. Objectives

To develop a GUI-based biometric system using Python and Tkinter.

To enroll user details with fingerprint images.

To store fingerprint features in a local JSON database.

To match a fingerprint image with stored data and verify user identity.

To demonstrate the use of ORB feature detection and histogram equalization for image processing.

3. Existing System

Traditional password or PIN-based authentication suffers from:

Password hacking and theft

Shoulder surfing

Forgetting passwords

Biometric authentication eliminates these issues by using unique human traits, making it more secure and reliable.

4. Proposed System

The proposed system allows:

Feature	Description
User Enrollment	Store fingerprint + name, age, gender, ID
Fingerprint Upload	Upload images for enrollment & verification
Feature Extraction	ORB algorithm to detect fingerprint keypoints
Matching	BFMatcher used to compare descriptor similarity
Result Display	Shows match result and user details
5. Technologies Used
Component	Technology
Programming Language	Python
GUI	Tkinter
Image Processing	OpenCV, NumPy
File Handling	JSON
Visualization	PIL (Pillow)
6. System Architecture
User → Upload Fingerprint → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction  
→ Database Storage → Fingerprint Matching → Result Output

10. Database Structure (JSON)
{
 "user_id": {
    "name": "John",
    "gender": "Male",
    "age": 22,
    "fingerprint": {
       "descriptors": [...],
       "hash": 12345678
    }
 }
}

11. Advantages
