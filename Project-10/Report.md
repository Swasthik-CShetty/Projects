# üîê Project Report: Password Cracking Challenge using John the Ripper

## 1. Introduction
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how weak passwords can be cracked using John the Ripper, a popular password-cracking tool. By creating hashed passwords, applying different wordlists and rules, and analyzing the results, we highlight the importance of using strong password policies to ensure better security.

## 2. Abstract
Passwords are still one of the most widely used methods of authentication, but weak or common passwords make systems vulnerable to attacks. This project simulates a password-cracking scenario where hashed passwords (MD5/SHA1) are created and tested against various wordlists using John the Ripper. The project emphasizes how quickly weak passwords can be cracked and provides recommendations for stronger password practices.

## 3. Tools Used
- **Operating System:** Kali Linux 2024.2  
- **Password Cracking Tool:** John the Ripper  
- **Wordlists:** Custom `wordlist_demo.txt`, `rockyou.txt`  
- **Hash Algorithms:** MD5 and SHA1  
- **Editor:** Nano/Vim for creating hash files  

## 4. Steps Involved in Building the Project
1. **Step 1:** Create a list of plaintext passwords.  
2. **Step 2:** Generate hashes (MD5/SHA1) using shell commands.  
3. **Step 3:** Run John with a custom wordlist.  
4. **Step 4:** Use `rockyou.txt` for more coverage.  
5. **Step 5:** Display cracked results.

## 6. Conclusion
This project demonstrated that weak or common passwords can be cracked within seconds using John the Ripper and publicly available wordlists. Out of 10 chosen passwords, 8 were successfully cracked, highlighting the danger of reusing predictable or dictionary-based passwords. Strong password policies and additional security measures are essential to defend against brute-force and dictionary attacks.

## 7. Challenges Faced
- Initially, `rockyou.txt` wordlist was missing and had to be installed/unzipped.  
- Some stronger passwords (`Secret@123`, `Secur3!Pass`) were not in the default wordlists.  
- Cracking times varied based on CPU performance and hash type.
